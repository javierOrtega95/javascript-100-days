# JavaScript 100 Days

This repository is a collection of projects to improve my JavaScript skills and to practice HTML and CSS concepts. Each project is designed to cover different aspects and challenges of web development, from basic to advanced levels.

## Repository Structure

Each project will have its own folder and will follow a similar structure:
